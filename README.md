# passphraseGenerator_V.1
A simple Passphrase Generator using a word list and Psuedo Random Number Generation

-----
In this generator, we generate random numbers to pick words from pre-made word banks 
 
IDEA: 
Is there any way you could make the math section into a function and then just call that? 
Can you pull from a seperate word list file?
